GENERAL IDEAS

Idea - Not sure how this will work for performance, but I'm going to put a carousel on the index/menu/photo gallery pages. Will try to customize each one in time.





*****THINGS TO DO*****

// GENERAL //
  replace top navbar code with 'navbar-inverse' class
    this means undoing the custom stylings to get the effects of inverse



// INDEX PAGE //

  unstick footer to bottom of page
    though flush it to bottom
  fonts
  add proper images (facebook)
    possibly resize
  tinker with background image
    possibly farther perspective  
  replace 'Brunzies' header with either logo image or different font
  optimize images to fit on carousel template on different devices



// MENU PAGE //




// CONTACT PAGE //

  add google map interface
